1. ## <u>Title</u>
> ### _#_ & _h_
>``` 
>    "#" is same as the "h1" in html
>    "##" = h2
>    etc.
>```
>This is the most common and easiest title to use.

> ### _=_ & _-_
>>place "=" one line under the object has the same effect as h1.
>>
>>    place "-" one line under the object has the same effect as h2.

2. ## <u>Paragraph</u>
> ### _"space"_
>>paragraph can just write in english or other anything.
>>But there is something should mention is: *line break*

> ### _line changing_
> #### The line changing in markdown is not the same like the paper writing in normal days. There are two ways you can choose as you changing the lines in the markdown.
>
>> 1. place a _double space_ after the paragraph. Like this:
>> 
>>_this is the first line<kbd>space</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>_
>>
>>_this is the second_
>
>> 2. place one more enter before the next line. Like this:
>>
>>_this is the first line<kbd>enter</kbd>_
>>
>>_<kbd>enter</kbd>_
>>
>>_this is the second_

>### _line breaking_
>> The line breaking in Markdown is same as html.
>> 
>> 
>>         <br> & <hr> can both work even in the blocks
>>
